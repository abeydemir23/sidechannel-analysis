make -- compiles code
make V=<version> run -- runs a certain version
	
	The versions are decided by their name: the prefix of all of them is Password,
	while the rest of the name is what the argument takes.

	Example:

		make V=ConstantTime run
		make V=NoLengthCheck run
		make V=Insecure run
		make V=Possibly run
		make V=PossiblyTwo run
