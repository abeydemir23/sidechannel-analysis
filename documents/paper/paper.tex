\subsection{Differences in side-channels due to language design}

To explore how different language syntax behaves with side-channels, we compared the implementation of \texttt{PasswordChecker} in Java and in Scala. Both languages share the JVM, although Scala is usually written in a mostly functional manner. The result of this paradigm shift is that most of the instructions found in Scala bytecode are method calls, presented in the bytecode as artificial anonymous classes, and subject to a large array of Scala analyses and optimizations at compile-time. This causes the side-channel to not appear, if written in the way most Scala programmers would typically align themselves with.

From this, we can see that the choice of valid language syntax and semantics based on formalism and consistency can help improve side-channel prevention, even though it isn't necessarily looking to solve that problem. The main reason behind why the side-channel isn't present in the Scala code is that all traversals through the sequence of characters are designed to be exactly $n * O(1)$, where $n$ is the length of the array, instead of being $O(n)$, as is the case with languages that allow early-returns, as is Java. Furthermore, if an attempt be made to write Java-like loops in Scala, a weak space side-channel could form as well, as the early break mechanisms are implemented via lazy structures, thus holding the rest of the calculation in memory while evaluating the start of the sequence. It follows that good performance strongly follows good practice in this case.
