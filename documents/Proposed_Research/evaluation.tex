\section{Evaluation}

We propose to evaluate our tool on a series of Java programs from the DARPA STAC program as well as a set of classic side channel vulnerabilites, such as CRIME \cite{crime} and simple string comparison. The DARPA STAC programs are sizable -- there are thousands of methods in each main application and tens of thousands when depdencencies are included. Side channel vulnerabilities are either in timing or space. Timing refers to the execution time of the program while space refers to either the number and sizes of encrypted packets sent over a network or to the size of output files resultant from some interaction. We plan to evaluate our method based on its ability to correctly locate side channel vulnerabilities in each of these programs. Our method will be considered successful if it is able to identify the loop or branch statements responsible for causing a side channel that leaks information about the provided secret value. Since our method is designed to be an over-approximation, we also plan to use this test suite to better understand how useful predicate abstraction and symbolic execution are as tools to elimate infeasible paths and reduce the number of false positives. 

%Since our method depends on a user defined threshold for the imbalance between paths, our test suite will also provide an means to evaluate the importance of this threshold. We plan to use this test suite to determine suitable values for both timing and space side channels. In the case of timing side channels, the threshold should be high enough so that the difference in time is observable even across a network. If the side channels in space are deterministic, then it may be the case that a threshold of zero is appropriate. \todo{probably to remove for space}
